# 0x0F. C - Function pointers
* This repository is a collection of code and files that I created during my time at school while learning about C function pointers. 
* It serves as a valuable resource for those seeking to understand and work with this fundamental concept in C programming.

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called function_pointers.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
